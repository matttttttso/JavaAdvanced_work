例文

public static String text =
   "Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by "
   + "her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or "
   + "twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but "
   + "it had no pictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use "
   + "of a book,\' thought Alice `without pictures or conversation?\'\n"
   + "So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, "
   + "for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether "
   + "the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble "
   + "of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White "
   + "Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.\nThere was nothing so "
   + "very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much "
   + "out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, `Oh dear! "
   + "Oh dear! I shall be late!\' (when she thought it over afterwards, "
   + "it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but "
   + "at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit "
   + "actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked "
   + "at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it "
   + "flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit "
   + "with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, "
   + "and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, "
   + "and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large "
   + "rabbit-hole under the hedge.";
